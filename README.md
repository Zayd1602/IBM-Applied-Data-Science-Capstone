# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

## Project Summary
The goal of the project is to use the data to predict whether the SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The data for this project was sourced form SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia using web scraping. Web wrangling was performed to make the data useful for Machine Learning and further analysis. SQL query was used to bring into light various insights from the data. Exploratory Data Analysis, feature scaling is done with visualization using scatter and bar plots to make the data insightful and determine the best predictors. Further, Machine Learning models are created to predict the future outcomes. 

## Outcome 
It was found that the predicted outcome was dependent on the Flight Number, Launch Site, Payload and Orbit.
